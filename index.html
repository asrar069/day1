<p>Interstellar (2014) follows Cooper, a former NASA pilot, who joins a mission to find a new home for humanity as Earth faces ecological collapse. 
        Traveling through a wormhole near Saturn, the team explores distant planets, grapples with time dilation, and faces emotional and scientific challenges.
        At its core, the film explores love, sacrifice, and the power of human resilienceâ€”blending real physics with deeply personal stakes.</p>
